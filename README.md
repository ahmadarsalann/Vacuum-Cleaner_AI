The instructions of this project are in the following URL.

All the supporting scripts in this github repo are made by Stephen Davies

What did I do:

I made the aahmad3_vacuum.py file.

What does it do:

This is the main script of the program that has the core logic of the automated bot.

The program takes into account those two percepts(dirty and Bump) and decides whether to move in one of the four cardinal directions, suck the current carpet location, or do nothing. The robot should get the room clean and try to minimize the amount of energy it consumes.
